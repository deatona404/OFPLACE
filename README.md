# OFPLACE

With crowdsourced urban planning, let's start shaping the future *of place*.

## Inspiration
The majority of our project group consists of individuals that do not own personal vehicles. We have to walk or take public transit everywhere. The majority of our group is also women. In an ideal world, those facts would not collide, but unfortunately, they do, and as a result we have a vested interest in safe, secure, and accessible urban environments.


## What it does
OFPLACE provides a medium for citizens to share their thoughts and ideas about the design, functionality, and sustainability of their city. OFPLACE features tools for mapping, data visualization, and interactive simulations, allowing contributors to see the potential impact of their ideas. It fosters feedback and collaboration between citizens and local government agencies to create a more democratic and inclusive urban planning process.


## How we built it
Our group had never used Figma for a project before, so we sat down and decided to create an entire interactable prototype in the aforementioned software. An actual codebase will be the next step if it is well-received.

## Challenges we ran into
As mentioned above, our Figma experience was basically nonexistent to start with, but we managed to learn quick with the help of CapTech's workshop.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Learning a valuable industry tool and creating a working prototype.

## What we learned
Diagramming and doing prototypes before diving into coding is essential for any successful project.

## What's next for OFPLACE
If OFPLACE's reception goes well, an actual codebase may soon follow our interactable prototype.
